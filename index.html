		<p>You get up, heading to the door. You decide to peek out...</p>
		<p>Oh no, the zombie is still there! It's looking the other way, so maybe you can sneak to the stairway which is to the left?</p>
		<p>Or maybe find some kind of weapon and try to kill the enemy? You look around and notice an axe.</p>
